A simple plugin for adding wind to h3vr.

max wind speed and rate of change is configurable in mod panel. 

"affectsRB" option uses lots of expensive calculations every single frame. could potentially cause performance issues. leave disabled if you are CPU-bound.

default value of 6 is good for challenging shooting on duney. a lot of smaller maps require high wind speeds to see any effect, because of the relatively short ranges involved.

feel free to turn it up to the thousands for jupiter-speed winds, but beware, it's possible your mod panel will be blown out of your hands if you don't freeze it.

gusts and a wind indicator might be added in the future. feel free to DIY
