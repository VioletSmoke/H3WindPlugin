A simple plugin for adding wind to h3vr.

max wind speed and rate of change is configurable in mod panel. 

for additional realism/difficulty, enable Perlin Wind in settings for wind that varies by location. version 0.0.5 and above only!

"affectsRB" option uses lots of expensive calculations every single frame. could potentially cause performance issues. leave disabled if you are CPU-bound.

default value of 6 is good for challenging shooting on duney. a lot of smaller maps require high wind speeds to see any effect, because of the relatively short ranges involved.

turn it up to the thousands for jupiter-speed winds, but beware, it's possible your mod panel will be blown out of your hands if you don't freeze it.

gusts are added, and there are two wind indicators available if you search for dependencies. feel free to use my code for any purpose.

Thanks to JerryAR for timely bug reports and his kestrel wind meter!
